# Fluid Solver
The goal of this project is to implement a GPU accelerated fluid solver in Unity as a part of the course Spelfysik at Högskolan i Skövde.

The solver is using the [smoothed-particle hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) (SPH) method for simulation.
